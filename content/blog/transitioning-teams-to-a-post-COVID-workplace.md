Last year, COVID-19 forced businesses to adapt to restrictions, with most transitioning to an online workspace. The use of virtual meeting software like Zoom and team messaging apps like Slack skyrocketed for jobs that could still be completed online.

However, as Australia gradually bounces back from the devastating effects that COVID-19 had on its economy and people, businesses are becoming more confident in welcoming their staff back into the office and adapting to a new post-COVID workplace.

Businesses must consider the implications of transitioning to a hybrid online and physical workplace on operations, people and safety, and should take advantage of the opportunity to reinvent traditional business practices.

Four key questions business leaders should ask are:

### **Use of technology**

Australian businesses invested hugely into online technologies that allowed operations to continue throughout the pandemic.

#### Use Apps

Using apps like Slack and Zoom allow employees to work from home, hot desk and use meeting rooms. These tools can still be used effectively if the workplace retains flexible remote work policies or if in-office capacity limits must be enforced.

## **Workplace safety**

Create a risk management plan and follow it so that the business is prepared in the event of changing health and safety regulations.

#### Create an office management system

This should include strict office cleaning schedules, use of contact tracing, desk arrangements that adhere to social distancing regulations, ensuring staff maintain personal hygiene with personal protective equipment (PPE) and offering ample sanitation facilities. 

#### Create larger spaces

Also, consider a multi-staged approach to reopening facilities to avoid larger groups.

## **Employee mental wellbeing**

The implications of COVID-19 go beyond business operations and individual situations must be treated with compassion and understanding.

#### Your team’s mental health is serious

Businesses should treat their employee’s mental health seriously to ensure they have access to ongoing support.

#### Provide a save space

This can include providing a safe space for communication like HR or counselling services to deal with anxiety or stress.

#### Include flexible working arrangements

It can also include flexible working arrangements or transport options for staff not comfortable returning to the office, and being compassionate towards lowered productivity as a result of stress or from time-consuming safety protocols.

## **Communicating with stakeholders**

Changes must be communicated to a company’s stakeholders in an engaging and empathetic way.

#### Be empathetic but firm

A mix of empathetic messaging towards employees, while firmly managing supplier and investor expectations, will result in healthy relationships and better productivity in the short and long term.

There are many decisions that business leaders must make for their post-COVID-19 workplace structure to be effective. 

It is a huge opportunity to implement initiatives that nurture staff and embrace technologies while regaining the integral face-to-face connection that we all missed.
