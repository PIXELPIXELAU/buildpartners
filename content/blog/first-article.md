**Transitioning teams to a post-COVID workplace**

Last year, COVID-19 forced businesses to adapt to restrictions, with most transitioning to an online workspace. Use of virtual meeting softwares like Zoom and team messaging apps like Slack skyrocketed for jobs that could still be completed online.

However, as Australia gradually bounces back from the devastating effects that COVID-19 had on its economy and people, businesses are becoming more confident in welcoming their staff back into the office and adapting to a new post-COVID workplace.

Businesses must consider the implications of transitioning to a hybrid online and physical workplace on operations, people and safety, and should take advantage of the opportunity to reinvent traditional business practices.

Four key questions business leaders should ask are:

**Use of technology**

_Will you keep using the online tools you invested in?_

Australian businesses invested hugely into online technologies that allowed operations to continue throughout the pandemic. Using apps like Slack and Zoom allow employees to work from home, hot desk and use meeting rooms. These tools can still be used effectively if the workplace retains flexible remote work policies or if in-office capacity limits must be enforced.

**Workplace safety**

_What office management systems will you use to prioritise health?_

Create a risk management plan and follow it so that the business is prepared in the event of changing health and safety regulations. This should include strict office cleaning schedules, use of contact tracing, desk arrangements that adhere to social distancing regulations, ensuring staff maintain personal hygiene with personal protective equipment (PPE) and offering ample sanitation facilities. Also consider a multi-staged approach to reopening facilities to avoid larger groups.

**Employee mental wellbeing**

_How will you support your team’s mental health?_

The implications of COVID-19 go beyond business operations and individual situations must be treated with compassion and understanding. Businesses should treat their employee’s mental health seriously to ensure they have access to ongoing support. This can include providing a safe space for communication like HR or counselling services to deal with anxiety or stress. It can also include flexible working arrangements or transport options for staff not comfortable returning to the office, and being compassionate towards lowered productivity as a result of stress or from time-consuming safety protocols.

**Communicating with stakeholders**

_How will you communicate changes?_

Changes must be communicated to a company’s stakeholders in an engaging and empathetic way. A mix of empathetic messaging towards employees, while firmly managing supplier and investor expectations, will result in healthy relationships and better productivity in the short and long term.

There are many decisions that business leaders must make for their post-COVID-19 workplace structure to be effective. It is a huge opportunity to implement initiatives that nurture staff and embrace technologies, while regaining the integral face-to-face connection that we all missed.
